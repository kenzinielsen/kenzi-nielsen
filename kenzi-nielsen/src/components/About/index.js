        <p>Hi, I'm Kenzi! 
            <br></br>
            I'm a Web Developer from Salt Lake City!
            <br></br>
            I enjoy learning new things, which is why I got into web development.
            <br></br>
            
            I love hiking, going to the beach and traveling with my boyfriend!
            <br></br>
            I'm also a HUGE animal lover.
